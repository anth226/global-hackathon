            We, including our third-party partners, automatically collect
            certain types of usage information when you use our Service, read
            our emails, or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this
            information through a variety of tracking technologies, including
            cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying
            technologies, file information, and similar technology
            (collectively, “<b>tracking technologies</b>”). For example, we
            collect information about your device and its software, such as your
            IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type,
            device type, operating system, date and time stamp (a unique ID that

            you access the Service, whether you open emails or click the links
            contained in emails, whether you access the Service from multiple

            application (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for
            Advertisers (“<b>IDFA</b>”), Google AdID, or Windows Advertising
            ID), mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile
            device operating system brand and model, phone number, and,
            depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location
            data, including GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or

            your personal data are:
          </p>
          <p>
            1) where the processing is necessary for the performance of a

            and freedoms – this includes our own legitimate interests and those
            of our affiliates) such as:

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Interest-Based Advertising.</b> We participate in interest-based
            advertising and use third-party advertising companies to serve you
            targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We may share
            or we may permit third-party online advertising networks, social
            media companies, and other third-party services to collect
            information about your use of our website over time so that they may
            play or display ads on our Service, on other devices you may use,
            and on other websites, apps, or services, including on Facebook.
            Typically, though not always, the information we share is provided
            through cookies or similar tracking technologies, which recognize
            the device you are using and collect information, including click
            stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the
            site, and other information. We and our third-party partners use
            this information to make the advertisements you see online more
            relevant to your interests, as well as to provide
            advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution,
            analytics, and market research.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Social Media Widgets and Advertising.</b> Our Service may include
            social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Google
            Plus, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, or other widgets.
            These social media companies may recognize you and collect
            information about your visit to our Service, and they may set a
            cookie or employ other tracking technologies. Your interactions with
            those features are governed by the privacy policies of those
            companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            We display targeted advertising to you through social media
            platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and others. These
            companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to
            direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our
            Service while those users are on the social media platform or to
            groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely
            commercial interests and demographics. These advertisements are
            governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies
            that provide them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Cross-Device Linking.</b> We, or our third-party partners, may
            link your various devices so that content you see on one device can
            result in relevant advertising on another device. We do this by
            collecting information about each device you use when you are logged
            in to our Service. We may also work with third-party partners who
            employ tracking technologies or the application of statistical
            modelling tools to determine if two or more devices are linked to a
            single user or household. We may share a common account identifier
            (such as an email address or user ID) with third-party advertising
            partners to help recognize you across devices. We, and our partners,
            can use this cross-device linkage to serve interest-based
            advertising and other personalized content to you across your
            devices, to perform analytics, and to measure the performance of our
            advertising campaigns.
